This is learning based project which I practise some basic React features. The idea of this project was taken from Colt Steele's Udemy course called [ The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) and followed along with videos and hopefully, added some extra feature.

The name of project learning-react-diceapp-1

Used Languages and methods:

1. class component
2. functional component
